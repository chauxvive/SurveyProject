>““Travel isn’t always pretty. It isn’t always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts, it even breaks your heart. But that’s okay. The journey changes you; it should change you. It leaves marks on your memory, on your consciousness, on your heart, and on your body. You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave something good behind.”

>― Anthony Bourdain

### Project:

A survey form project for the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Design curriculum

### The Problem:

Create a one-page survey on a chosen subject in the style of [this site]( https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP).
  
* Must complete a series of [user stories](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form)

* Must be aesthetically pleasing and use HTML and CSS.

### Why travel?

I have always wanted to travel but for years was subconsciously waiting for permission: travel was for other people- wealthy people, accomplished people, people being taken by other experienced travelers. I sat at home and learned languages, alone. As the internet, smart phone, and travel communities expanded, however, I suddenly realized that travel wasn't just for other people, something you needed "a good reason" for. All I had to do was get in the car and drive or buy a plane ticket, alone or with some unwitting partner. Now my husband and I have done several 9000 mile road trips around the country (only 7 states left to visit!) and backpacked Europe for 3 months. We've stayed in castles for free in Scotland, partied until dawn in Ibiza, drank in the Monte Carlo, sailed in Mexico, and done residencies in Buddhist temples and have friends all over the world. Travel teaches about languages, resiliance, making friends, and self-sufficiency in a way I think nothing else can. Brian, my husband, jokes that my favorite destination is "forward". 

### Technologies Used:

HTML5 and CSS3

### Future upgrades:

I styled this in a very utilitarian way and look forward to coming back and making it really nice and stylish.
